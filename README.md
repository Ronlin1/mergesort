# mergesort
Python Implementation.

The merge sort algorithm adopts the divide-and-conquer algorithm paradigm to sort elements within a list efficiently. 
The algorithm was developed in 1945 by John Von Neumann.
Merge sort operation follows the basis of dividing the list into halves and continuously dividing the new halves 
down to their individual component.

Out-place Sorting: This type of sorting algorithm requires extra space after sorting
